An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear after all positive numbers.

Examples : 

Input: -12, 11, -13, -5, 6, -7, 5, -3, -6
Output: 5,  11,  6, -5, -13, -7, -12, -3, -6

Note: Order of elements is not important here.
