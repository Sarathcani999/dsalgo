## Find the longest substring of a string containing k distinct characters
Given a string and a positive number k, find the longest substring of the string containing k distinct characters. If k is more than the total number of distinct characters in the string, return the whole string.

## Find all substrings of a string that are a permutation of another string
Find all substrings of a string that contains all characters of another string. In other words, find all substrings of the first string that are anagrams of the second string.

## Find the longest substring of a string containing distinct characters
Given a string, find the longest substring containing distinct characters.

## Find maximum length sequence of continuous ones (Using Sliding Window)
Given a binary array, find the index of 0 to be replaced with 1 to get a maximum length sequence of continuous ones.

## Find the maximum sequence of continuous 1’s formed by replacing at-most k zeroes by ones
Given a binary array, find the maximum sequence of continuous 1’s that can be formed by replacing at most k zeroes by ones.

## Find minimum sum subarray of size k
Given an integer array, find the minimum sum subarray of size k, where k is a positive integer.

## Find a subarray having the given sum in an integer array
Given an integer array, find a subarray having a given sum in it.

## Find the smallest subarray length whose sum of elements is greater than k
Given an array of positive integers, find the smallest subarray’s length whose sum of elements is greater than a given number k.

## Find the count of distinct elements in every subarray of size k
Given an array and an integer k, find the count of distinct elements in every subarray of size k.

## Print all subarrays of an array having distinct elements
Given an integer array, print all maximum size subarrays having all distinct elements in them.

## Count distinct absolute values in a sorted array
Given an array of sorted integers that may contain several duplicate elements, count the total number of distinct absolute values in it.

## Find duplicates within a range k in an array
Given an array and a positive number k, check whether the array contains any duplicate elements within the range k. If k is more than the array’s size, the solution should check for duplicates in the complete array.
